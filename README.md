## WAT

Helps you to quickstart mattermost locally using docker.

Also see the rancher catalog for the production grade https://github.com/EugenMayer/docker-rancher-extra-catalogs one

### Usage

No need to build any images, just start it

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Now connect to `http://localhost:8000`

### Images

The images are build right based the original repository at `https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-docker`
and then published under 

 - https://hub.docker.com/r/eugenmayer/mattermost-app ( `eugenmayer/mattermost-app` )
 - https://hub.docker.com/r/eugenmayer/mattermost-db (`eugenmayer/mattermost-db`)
 
Check the `docker-compose.yaml` to see how they are used - but in the end, those are the originals ( see `build.sh` )
so just use the official documentation.

### Build the images yourself

Just run

```bash
./build.sh 5.13.2 myname/mattermost
```

To build your own images which then are tagged lile
 - `myname/mattermost-app:team-5.13.2` - that's the app image
 - `myname/mattermost-db:team-5.13.2` - that's the db image
